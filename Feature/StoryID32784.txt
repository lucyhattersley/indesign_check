 Twitter
Posting on Twitter is the best place to share your project. Include a brief description, pictures, and any relevant links if you have a blog for the build, along with the #MonthOfMaking and #MyLatestBuild. You can also tag in @The MagPi and we’ll make sure to share it ourselves, and maybe even feature it in the magazine!
