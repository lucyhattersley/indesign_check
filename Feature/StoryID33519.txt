 Twitter
Here at The MagPi and at Raspberry Pi, we love to see and share stuff on Twitter. It’s a great way to get a lot of people to interact with your builds, and also get some help if you need it. Along with using the #MonthOfMaking tag, you can keep an eye out for #MagPiMonday posts, and don’t forget to tag anything you build with #MyLatestBuild.
