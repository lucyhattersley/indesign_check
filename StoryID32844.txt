 Instagram
We love using Instagram, and posting amazing project builds on there is a great way to get them seen, and to find other amazing folks who are posting build photos. Using the #MonthOfMaking hashtag will get it seen by folks looking at that tag and if you want to post more photos of your build, you can always make it into a story using the story feature!
