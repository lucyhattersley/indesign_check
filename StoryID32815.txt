 Reddit
There are many relevant subreddits for different project types – although the Raspberry Pi subreddit is a good place to go for any Raspberry Pi-related projects you want to post. Upload some images to Imgur when you’ve finished your project, mark your post as ‘Show and Tell’, and it’s ready to show! We like to keep an eye on Reddit, so we’ll look out for any #MonthOfMaking posts!
