Paul from Pimoroni was the one who created the logo for Raspberry Pi, and the Pimoroni online store is one of the oldest Raspberry Pi-related maker stores. As well as the famous Pibow case made from laser-cut acrylic, they’ve created a huge number of fun and amazing Raspberry Pi and maker kits and accessories over the years, and stock a lot of Adafruit’s stuff for UK buyers as well.
