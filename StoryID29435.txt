 Instructables
Instructables is one of the oldest sites out there for finding amazing project guides and ideas, and we’ve been fans of it for years. The best part is you can search by specific project types as well, including Raspberry Pi if you’d like to keep it on-brand. They’ve recently added more arts and crafts stuff if you fancy trying your hand at knitting.
