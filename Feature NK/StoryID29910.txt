Read and understand
Basing your build on a tutorial you’ve seen? Seen a few things you’d like to combine into something else? Always make sure to read the instructions you’ve found properly so that you know if it’s within your skill level.



Order supplies
Write a list of what you need. Always doublecheck you have the component you think you have. Sometimes you may need to buy from separate places, so just make sure the delivery times work for you. 



Follow along and be safe
Need adult supervision for a project? Absolutely get some. Even adults need to be wary, so always take safety precautions and wear protective clothing when needed. Make sure to follow any tutorials you’ve found as closely as 	you can.
