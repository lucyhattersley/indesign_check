Posting on Twitter is the best place to share your project. Include a brief description, pictures, and any relevant links if you have a blog for the build, tagged with #MonthOfMaking and #MyLatestBuild. You can also tag in 
@The MagPi and we’ll make sure to share it ourselves, and maybe even feature it in the magazine!
